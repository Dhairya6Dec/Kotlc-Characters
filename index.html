                Sophie Elizabeth Foster is the main protagonist in the Keeper of the Lost Cities series. All of the books except
                 for a few parts of Unlocked are from her perspective. Some of her titles include that she is a member of the Black Swan and a Regent for the Council on Team Valiant. Between her training with the Black Swan, bouts with the Neverseen, and missions for Team Valiant, she attends Foxfire Academy and lives with the Ruewens, her adoptive parents. She also searches out the truth about her past and purpose, which are shrouded in mystery – in particular, her biological father as Sophie later discovers that Councillor Oralie was, in fact, her biological mother.
                 As part of Project Moonlark, the Black Swan genetically altered Sophie's DNA before birth, giving her a powerful variety of different abilities. Next, they implanted her in a human to be raised as part of the Foster family. She lived in San Diego as part of this family for the first twelve years of her life. After Fitz discovered her, Grady and Edaline Ruewen adopted her when she first came to the Lost Cities in the first book, although she chose not to take Ruewen as her last name.

                Foxfire is the most prestigious academy for young elves in the Lost Cities. It is also the only "noble school" - which means that graduation from Foxfire is one of the many qualifications for the Nobility. As stated by Bronte, Foxfire has been there a long time before the human "middle ages." Given Bronte's age, the Foxfire would have had to be founded at least around 2000 BC. It is located in North Africa, seemingly near modern-day Egypt. It is somewhat a jeweled oasis in the middle of the desert, with its colorful towers and glass pyramid.

The academy is named after the rare bio-luminescence found in otherwise, dark, lonely places - and as such, Foxfire prodigies are expected to be a bright, welcome glow in an often-darkened world.

The teachers in Foxfire are called mentors and wear orange capes. The students are called prodigies and wear colors corresponding to their level. All classes are taught one-on-one so that lessons can be modified to fit each prodigy. The Telepathy session between Fitz and Sophie with Tiergan as a mentor is an exception to this rule. This also excludes physical education and agriculture, which are done with all prodigies on certain days. Along with teaching, Mentors are also in charge of taking turns teaching detention. Mentors also have the ability to give prodigies detention. The Foxfire staff takes turns choosing flavors for the locker DNA strips, that students lick to gain access to their locker, mentioned in Book 1: Keeper of the Lost Cities.

Every day starts with an orientation where the principal reads announcements while other mentors take attendance of all the students using their registry pendants. Magnate Leto, also known as Mr. Forkle, is the current Foxfire Principal.

        <div class="Fitz">
            <h1>Fitz Vacker</h1>
            <center><img src="https://th.bing.com/th/id/OIP.BxqNyPJjapCpGyshtCr6agHaLH?w=204&h=306&c=7&r=0&o=5&pid=1.7"></center>
            <p>
                Fitz has one little sister, Biana Amberly Vacker , and one older brother, Alvar, who was later discovered to be a member of the Neverseen. His best friend is Keefe. He and Keefe drifted apart when Keefe joined the Neverseen, but their relationship slowly mended itself afterward. His parents are Alden Vacker, a Telepath, and Della Vacker, a Vanisher.  

Fitz was the second-youngest elf to get his nexus off, until his sister, Biana, broke his record. He was also the second youngest ever to manifest as a telepath, behind Sophie. He used to be the Splotching champion before Sophie beat him by accidentally using a Brain Push.

When writing the first version of Keeper of the Lost Cities, Shannon Messenger created Fitz as the first character. He was originally created to look for Sophie and quickly find out she's an elf. This was not the final product, seeing as it was a short story with the ending being Sophie finding out she is an elf, and now there is an entire series.
<h3>Abilities:</h3>
<h4>Telepath</h4>
<p>Fitz is a Telepath, the youngest telepath to naturally manifest before Sophie came. He is Sophie's Cognate, allowing the two to increase their abilities when working together. They have a pair of matching rings that snap together when their minds connect. He has a lot of potential and is proud of his talent.  </p>
<h4>Telekinisis</h4>
<p>Fitz is very good at telekinesis. In Foxfire splotching competitions, he almost always wins but Sophie beats him. He also demonstrates this skill throughout the series. For example, when Dex tosses him a gadget in Neverseen, Fitz catches it with his mind, spinning it in the air a few times.  </p>
<h4>Levitation</h4>
            <p>Fitz is also capable of levitating. Prior to attending Exillium, he is able to levitate up or down. At Exillium, he learns to levitate in multiple directions, which he struggles with at first, until he jumps off a cliff after Sophie and quickly learns on the spot. Fitz also demonstrates levitation in Flashback when he levitates Sophie and himself high enough so Sophie can teleport multiple times. </p>

                "Biana may seem like the Princess of Foxfire Academy—but dont let the perfect hair and fashionable clothes fool you. Beneath the make-up and perfectly coordinated accessories is a fearless fighter. And while she may not have manifested her special ability when we first meet her, that never stops her from taking on Fitz and Keefe in a game of base quest, (and no, it’s not just because she thinks Keefe is cute—though that definitely *does* help). She’s also an incredibly loyal friend—once she gets to know someone—and will do whatever it takes to protect the people she cares about.

<h3>physical traits</h3>
<p>"Biana may seem like the Princess of Foxfire Academy—but don’t let the perfect hair and fashionable clothes fool you. Beneath the make-up and perfectly coordinated accessories is a fearless fighter. And while she may not have manifested her special ability when we first meet her, that never stops her from taking on Fitz and Keefe in a game of base quest, (and no, it’s not just because she thinks Keefe is cute—though that definitely *does* help). She’s also an incredibly loyal friend—once she gets to know someone—and will do whatever it takes to protect the people she cares about.</p>
<h3>Personality</h3>
<p>In the first book, Biana is very cold towards Sophie, often insulting or ignoring her and sending her cold glares. But finally, she was ordered by her father to befriend Sophie. From there as the series progresses, Biana opens up to Sophie and they become best friends.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="Grady">
            <h1>Grady and Edaline Ruewen</h1>
            <center><img src="https://th.bing.com/th/id/OIP.GUxfX5p1Tb5Naf8IxK8A4QHaJT?w=163&h=205&c=7&r=0&o=5&pid=1.7"></center>
            <p>He is a Mesmer. Grady has also expressed to no one in particular that he is afraid of losing control of his ability because of how dangerous it can be. He also admits to Sophie that being a Mesmer is hard, people kept doubting his power and he even got teased by Edaline's parents, they'd asked if Grady had mesmerized Edaline into engaging him or by her own free will.

                He worked for the Councillors until they wouldn’t let him look into Jolie’s death. After Alden's mind broke, Grady became an Emissary again to honor his friend and was given a mission to find 30 missing dwarves from King Enki.
                
                He then resigned again in Everblaze because of Sophie's ability restrictor. Grady is married to Edaline.
                
                He and Edaline adopted Sophie 16 years after their daughter, Jolie, died in a fire. The fire was caused by Brant, a Pyrokinetic and member of the Neverseen, who was her fiancé at the time.
                
                He and Edaline own and run an animal rehabilitation center at Havenfield.
                
                As stated in Everblaze, Sophie figured out Grady is about a couple centuries older than she had believed.</p>
                <h3>Personality</h3>
                <h5>Protective</h5>
                Grady is very protective—specifically of Sophie—, willing to be sent to Exile to prevent Sophie from being punished, and not wanting any boys he doesn't approve of (i.e. Keefe ) to be near her. The reason he started calling Keefe "That Boy" is because he hurt Sophie by joining the Neverseen. He also didn't like when Sophie and Fitz started dating. He was likely as protective of Jolie as he is to Sophie.
                
                <h5>Strong Willed</h5>
                Grady is often stubborn at times when it comes to protecting Sophie. He almost never takes "No" for an answer. In Book 5: Lodestar, Sophie says that "Reasoning with Grady was sometimes like trying to give Verdi something new to eat."
                
                <h5>Worry</h5>
                Grady sometimes worries, in Book 1: Keeper of the Lost Cities, when Sophie lit a fire for Gildie, Grady yelled at her to get in the house.
                
                <h5>Caring</h5>
                Grady is constantly caring towards Sophie and Edaline. For example, in Book 1: Keeper of the Lost Cities, when Edaline was crying, Grady was comforting and telling her that it would be okay.
            <h1>Edaline</h1>
                <center><img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/lost-cities-keeper/images/0/02/Screen_Shot_2017-10-02_at_5.13.32_PM.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/288?cb=20171002221407"></center>
            <p>Edaline Kelia Ruewen (pronounced Ed-uh-leen Kee-lee-uh Ru-when) is the adoptive mother of Sophie Foster. She lives at Havenfield with Sophie and her husband, Grady.

                Edaline is a part of the Nobility. She was working on an important classified project-Sophie later found out that it had something to do with monitoring the Mermaid migration- when her daughter Jolie was killed. She then pulled away and has not returned since.
                
                Her first (and biological) daughter, Jolie, died in a fire accidentally sparked by Jolie's fiancé, Brant. Edaline is shown to have social anxiety, especially in public, due to Jolie's death.
                
                She is a Conjurer, and rehabilitates animals with her husband, Grady Ruewen.
                
                Edaline and Grady were once socialites (throwing massive parties, and being even more famous than the Vackers), but they began secluding themselves after Jolie's death, ultimately causing them to be talked about constantly and used as a 'cautionary tale'.</p>
                <h3>Appearance</h3>
                <p>Edaline has turquoise eyes and wavy amber hair. Sophie thinks that she is probably the most beautiful woman she's ever seen excluding Della Vacker. She's often described to have bags under her eyes, caused by the death of Jolie, her grief, her stress, and her worry. She appears similar to her sister, Juline Dizznee, so much so that Dex grew tearful when he saw Edaline after being separated from his own mother.</p>
                <h3>Personality</h3>
<p>Edaline is described to look like a delicate, grief-stricken flower, but she can wrangle a Tyrannosaurus Rex with ease. Apart from that, Edaline is very dedicated to her loved ones, and cares about them a lot. Before Jolie died, she and her husband Grady were very outgoing. Since then, they have secluded themselves in their house, alone until Sophie came. At first, Edaline struggled with getting used to Sophie, going as far as canceling her adoption. However, she soon realized how much she meant to her and accepted Sophie as her daughter.

    Edaline is genuinely a kind person who cares about other people, even though she may still be gaining her socializing skills back.</p>

        <div class="Alden">

            <center><img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/lost-cities-keeper/images/6/60/Alden_Pic.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/335?cb=20180919175901"></center>
            <p>Alden Dedrick Vacker is a member of the prestigious Vacker family. He is the husband of Della Adara Vacker and the father of Alvar Soren Vacker, Fitzroy Avery Vacker, and Biana Amberly Vacker.

                He lives in Everglen with Della, Fitz, and Biana. He works for The Council as an Emissary — members of the Nobility who are sent on special missions, usually as diplomatic representatives. Because of his job, he often wears a midnight blue cape. As revealed in Book 8: Legacy, he is an Emissary with the highest level of clearance.
                
                His trademark line is "no reason to worry," which he uses to reassure and support the people around him.</p>
                <h4>Appearance</h4>
<p>Alden has teal eyes and wavy dark brown hair. There is a strong resemblance between himself and his son, Fitzroy Avery Vacker.

    He is noted to have very kind eyes, causing Sophie to trust him when she first came to live with the elves. He and his family are all strikingly handsome, their beauty being notable compared even to most other elves. Alden has a highly recognizable accent, much like Fitz and, presumably, his daughter Biana.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="Dex">
            <h1>Dexter Dizznee</h1>
        <center> <img src="https://th.bing.com/th/id/OIP.jILu3YqXyu4AlaEyopnR8QAAAA?pid=ImgDet&w=267&h=400&rs=1"></center>
        <p>Dexter (more commonly known as "Dex") Alvin Dizznee is a member of both the Black Swan and Team Valiant, and is a Level Four prodigy.

            He is a Technopath and Sophie Foster's adoptive cousin and best friend. He was one of the very first elves Sophie met after she moved into the Lost Cities.
            
            Before Sophie arrived, Dex had no friends. He ate lunch in his alchemy session (revealed in Lodestar), and got ignored and discriminated against by the other kids at Foxfire, including Fitz and Biana Vacker because his parents are a bad match.
            
            When he met Sophie at Slurps and Burps, he told his mother, Juline, about it. He (as explained by Juline) asked to go to Havenfield to meet Sophie again.
            
            <h3>Appearance</h3>
            <p>Dexter in Latin means "right-handed, skilled." From an occupational surname, it means "one who dyes." His last name Dizznee sounds a lot like the company Disney, which made Dex think that he had his own land when Sophie showed him pictures from her scrapbook of her at Disneyland.</p>
            Dex has strawberry blond curly hair, periwinkle eyes and prominent dimples that show up when he smiles. He is described as skinny, and short up until his growth spurt in the Neverseen. His growth spurt continues in Nightfall, growing to be the same height as Keefe. As of Exile, it is revealed that he has a burn scar on his side below his ribs, the size and shape of a thumbprint which was made by Brant, the Neverseen member who had tortured him when he was kidnapped along with Sophie in Keeper of the Lost Cities.</p>
